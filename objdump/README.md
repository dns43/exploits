https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/1763102

finish_stab in stabs.c in GNU Binutils 2.30 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by an out-of-bounds write of 8 bytes. This can occur during execution of objdump.	

more precisely, finish_stab loops over NULL-valued stab-tags, and does sth with them.
Loop most be off by one or so o.O

*.txt has Address Sanatizer Output
others are files to trigger mal behavior
