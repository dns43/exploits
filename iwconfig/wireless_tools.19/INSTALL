You need :
--------
	o A kernel supporting wireless extensions
		-> from 2.1.17 onward
		-> from 2.0.30 onward
		-> patch available for 1.2.13
		Note : CONFIG_NET_RADIO must be enabled
	o Driver supporting wireless extensions
		-> Wavelan isa from kernel 2.1.17 onward
		-> Wavelan pcmcia from pcmcia 2.9.2 onward
		-> Netwave pcmcia from pcmcia 2.9.12 onward
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia drivers
		-> Proxim RangeLan2/Symphony driver
		-> Patch your favourite driver
	Note : more recent kernels and drivers are likely to support
		more wireless extension features...

Compile wireless tools :
----------------------
	In theory, a make should suffice.
	In practice, there is big troubles with the headers. Depending
on which version of the kernel headers (might be different from
kernel) and library headers you have, you need to play with the
options buried in iwcommon.h.
